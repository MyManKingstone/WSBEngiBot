- [x] Create and Run Task
	<!-- No task needed for Express app -->

- [ ] Fix the await issues with the schedule loading from the excel file
	<!-- Make sure that the schedule loads properly before any commands are run that need it -->

- [ ] Launch the Project
	<!-- Ready to launch with npm start -->

- [ ] Ensure Documentation is Complete
	<!-- README.md created and up to date -->

- [ ] Verify Code Quality 
	<!-- Make sure theres clear comments and instructions on how to use all the functions and how they work / are constructed -->

- [ ] Make Future Improvements
	<!-- Consider adding error handling and input validation to enhance robustness, maybe even add a self restart function for any big errors -->

- [ ] Make Sure the Code allows for future api addition, such that other apps can interface with it
	<!-- Consider using modular architecture and clear API endpoints to facilitate future integrations -->

- [ ] Make the website more user friendly
	<!-- Consider improving the UI/UX design for better navigation and accessibility, add dark mode and "AMOLED" dark mode -->

-	[ ] Add current events into the website
	<!-- Make sure that any discord based announcements also make it to the website, using only the single latest piece of announcements will do fine-->

- [ ] Optimize Performance
	<!-- Review the code for any potential performance bottlenecks and optimize as necessary -->

- [ ] Stop the website from being a resource hog, and requesting constant schedule updates from the app, maybe load the schedule once and cache it for a set amount of time
	<!-- Make sure that the website does not use too much ram or cpu, optimize any heavy functions -->

- [ ] Add Room for future expansion of the website and our "database" of schedules, roles, and announcements
	<!-- Make sure that the code is modular and can be expanded upon easily in the future -->
